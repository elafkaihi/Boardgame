# README: Install and Set Up Trivy in a CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and setting up Trivy, a vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts, in a CI/CD pipeline. Trivy can scan your Docker images to detect vulnerabilities and integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that only secure images are deployed.

## Prerequisites

- A CI/CD tool such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.
- Docker installed on your CI/CD server or agents.
- Access to your Docker registry.

## Step 1: Install Trivy

You can install Trivy on your local machine or CI/CD server using one of the following methods:

### Install via Shell Script

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Install via Docker

You can also run Trivy as a Docker container:

```sh
docker pull aquasec/trivy:latest
```

## Step 2: Run a Local Scan (Optional)

You can run a local scan to test Trivy installation:

```sh
trivy image your-docker-image:tag
```

Replace `your-docker-image:tag` with the name of your Docker image.

## Step 3: Integrate Trivy with Your CI/CD Pipeline in Jenkins 

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed and set up Trivy in your CI/CD pipeline. Trivy will now scan your Docker images for vulnerabilities during the build process, helping to ensure that only secure images are deployed to production.
